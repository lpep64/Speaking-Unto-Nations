we'll meet again don't know where don't know when
 but I know we'll meet again some sunny day
 keep smiling through just like you always do
 till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away
 so will you please say hello to the folks that I know tell them I won't be long they'll be happy to know that as you saw me go I was singing this song
 We'll Meet Again don't know where don't know when
 but I know we'll meet again some sunny day
